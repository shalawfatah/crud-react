# Note-taking App
- This app is a basic CRUD operation (Create, Write, Update, Delete) using Javascript
- I used React in the frontend (& Tailwind) and NodeJS (Express) in the backend.
- I used MongodDB and Mongoose Library to update the database
- This is a custom full-stack app, no additional CMSs or libraries are used to make the operations easier.
- This is a project that I build to learn any new framework, as it covers a lot in terms of what is expected of what developers do with the language.
